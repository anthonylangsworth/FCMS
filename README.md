# FCMS
Fleet Carrier MS plug-in

This is based off the Fuel Rats EDMC plug-in, given my inability to find their git repo. 

To install:
 1. Shut down EDMC.
 2. Navigate to the EDMC plug-ins folder, normally "C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\EDMarketConnector\plugins\", replacing "<user>" with your user name.
 3. Create a folder called "FCMS".
 4. Copy the "load.py" file to that folder.
 5. Restart EDMC.
